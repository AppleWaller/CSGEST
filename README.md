## TODO

- [ ] remove jsoncpp.lib(2.1M), integrate src as a git submodule.
- [ ] remove gtestd.lib(3.5M), integrate src as a git submodule.
- [ ] use cmake to manage the project building.
- [x] create a new repo to replace this, because this repo has a too large .git folder(9M).
      After deleting `xcode` and `vim` branches, .git decrease to 3M, so I needn't create a new repo anymore.
